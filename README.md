# A List of Presentations Held by Niko Heikkilä

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/bf7cc78b-07f2-4249-8015-342bcd2423c8/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/slides-nikoheikkila/deploys)

This project collects together all the presentation slides I've held.

Under the hood, project uses the **Hugo** static site generator with [`reveal-hugo`][theme] theme which compiles the Markdown slides to **Reveal.js** compatible output for browsers. Slides are hosted in **Netlify**.

> **But, but, why you no PowerPoint?**

1. slide contents are open-source and easy to contribute
2. access anywhere without remembering where you stored those `*.ppt` files
3. full control of themes and styling – not limited to basic templates
4. impress your colleagues struggling with dragging elements in PowerPoint or Google Slides
